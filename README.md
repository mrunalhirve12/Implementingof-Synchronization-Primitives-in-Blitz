# Operating-System-Foundations---Project-2
Implementation of synchronization primitives

In this project we will be able to know about threads and gain familiarity writing programs involving concurrency control and multi-threading. Project involves implementation of Producer consumer and lock unlock methods.

In addition we will gain familiarity programming in the KPL language.

Code written in: Main.c Synch.c Synch.h
